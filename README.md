Building a simple LAMP stack and deploying Application using Ansible Playbooks.
-------------------------------------------

These playbooks require Ansible 1.2.

These playbooks are meant to be a reference and starter's guide to building
Ansible Playbooks. These playbooks were tested on Ubuntu 14.04

This LAMP stack can be on a single node or multiple nodes. The inventory file
'hosts' defines the nodes in which the stacks should be configured.

        [webservers]
        localhost

        [dbservers]
        mysqlhost

Here the webserver would be configured on the local host and the dbserver on a
server called "mysqlhost". The stack can be deployed using the following
command:

        ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml

Once done, you can check the results by browsing to http://localhost/index.php.
You should see a simple test page and a list of databases retrieved from the
database server.
